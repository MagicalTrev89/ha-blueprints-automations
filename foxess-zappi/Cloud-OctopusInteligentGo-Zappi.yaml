    # Overview
    
    When using Octopus Energy with an Zappi charger, this automation will prevent FoxESS battery discharge into the car while
    charging.
    Octopus provide intelligent charging windows during the day, this blueprint will charge the FoxESS battery during these
    windows to ensure that the car is charged using the cheapest electricity.
    Octopus also provide off peak electricity at night, this blueprint will also charge the battery during these times.

    # This is an testing version of this blueprint specifically for Zappi users.

      description: The HA Octopus integration provides sensors for cheap and intelligent dispatching, but these sensors can sometimes lag behind or not update correctly at all. Enabling optimistic charging will ignore the Octopus sensors and follow the EV charger instead, this means that if you force charge your EV outside of a cheap period the house battery will also charge at this more expensive rate. For Zappi it is recommended to disable this option.
