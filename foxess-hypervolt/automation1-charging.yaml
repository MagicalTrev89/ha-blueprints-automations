  name: Automation 1 - Charge FoxESS Battery With Car When off peak includes battery protection
  author: TechGuides
  source_url: https://github.com/MagicalTrev89/ha-blueprints-automations/blob/master/foxess-hypervolt/automation1-charging.yaml
  description: > 
    This will charge the battery when octopus is off peak  
     **Octopus off peak** is when the rate is low
     The Hypervolt charger current will be checked to ensure that charging only
     takes place when Inteligent dispatching is fully working
     
     The Input sensors for this automation have been filtered, there is validation
     to ensure that you select the correct sensor, look for notification errors
     
     Due to validation, if you want to manually trigger this automation you must create
     a helper button called: input_button.auto1_manual_trigger
